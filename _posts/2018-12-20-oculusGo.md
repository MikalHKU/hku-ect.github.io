## VR headsets

Slowly more and more different VR headsets are being developed and are becoming available for consumers to buy. There are also more different types of headsets arising. You can get headsets that you need to connect to your PC (and need a powerfull graphics card) such as the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive. You have a variety of stand-alone goggles. There you basically have a plastic or cardboard box with a pair of lenses where you need to add the screen yourself in the form of a mobile telephone. The most common being the GearVR which only works with newer Samsung phones or the Google cardboard for capable Android pfones.

The latest trend is the development of standalone VR headsets which are a all in one unit with lenses, screen and some sort of a computer. For example the Oculus Go or the Oculus Quest. 
These try to bridge the gap between the Powerful but thethered headsets and the cheap but limited phone based solutions.

## Oculus Go

The Oculus Go is a standalone VR headset with 3 degrees of freedom. This meana that you can look around and up/down, but if you move your head to the side or take a step this movement is not translated to the headset. If you want to be able to walk around with the headset you need a tethered headset such as a Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or one of the Microsoft mixed reality headsets such as for example the Dell Visor.

## Oculus Go and Unity

With the Oculus Rift and hTC Vive you can develop in Unity and ddirectly see the result when pressing play if you used the correct unity settings. With the Android based VR headsets such as Google cardboard and GearVR you need to built a Android app from Unity and then let Unity install the app on the phone.

For the Oculus Go you have roughly the same building pipeline as for GearVR or Google Cardboard since the Oculus Go is also Android based.


### Steps in summary

1. Signup as a Oculus developer and create an organisation
2. Enable developer mode on the Oculus Go
3. Install the Java SDK (and set the path)
4. Setup Android SDK commandline tools and ADB
5. Install Unity with Android support
6. Connect Oculus go to your computer
7. Start new Unity project and change project settings relevan tfor building to the Oculus Go

### Step in Detail

There are many different online tutorials you can follow to build a Unity app for the Oculus Go, but the one I followed and found the most clear can be found here:

[Unity on Ocullus Go quick start](https://scriptable.com/blog/oculus-go-unity-setup-quick-start)

If you follow the steps in the above link you wil be ready and setup for making VR content for the Oculus Go


## Things to consider

* Make sure Unity can find you android SDKA
* Make sure you have a recen enough version of the android SDK to be able to buitl for the Oculus Go
* Study the Oculus Utilities for example scenes and code to figure out how you can work with the Oculus Go
* Make sure that Oculus Utilities folder whithin your project is writable by Unity otherwise you wil get build errors.
